# Chesston
This application extends the [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) library with a user interface. To make the actual gameplay server independant, chess.js is included in this solution. :joystick:

The artifical player currently plays random moves only.

The CSS of this application is inspired by Googles Material Design and roughly follows the guidelines on [material.io](https://material.io/). The Roboto font is included in this repository.

The chess pieces are from ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece)). Replace the png files with custom ones if you wish to customize the board.
